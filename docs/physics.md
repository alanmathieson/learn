3  Subject content
This syllabus gives you the flexibility to design a course that will interest, challenge and engage your learners.
Where appropriate you are responsible for selecting subject contexts, resources and examples to support your
learners’ study. These should be appropriate for the learners’ age, cultural background and learning context as
well as complying with your school policies and local legal requirements.
Candidates for Cambridge International AS Level should study topics 1–11.
Candidates for Cambridge International A Level should study all topics.
The content of the AS Level learning outcomes is assumed knowledge for the A Level components.
Teachers should refer to the social, environmental, economic and technological aspects of physics wherever
possible throughout the syllabus. Some examples are included in the syllabus and teachers should encourage
learners to apply the principles of these examples to other situations introduced in the course.
The syllabus content for practical skills is in the Practical assessment section.
Teachers should ensure that candidates are prepared for the assessment of both theory learning outcomes
and practical skills.
Support for teaching practical skills for these qualifications can be found on the School Support Hub
www.cambridgeinternational.org/support
Data and formulae
Data and formulae will appear as page 2 in Papers 1 and 2 and pages 2 and 3 in Paper 4. The data and
formulae are shown in section 6.
Decimal markers
In accordance with current ASE convention, decimal markers in examination papers will be a single dot on the
line. Candidates are expected to follow this convention in their answers.
## Units
In practical work, candidates will be expected to use SI units or, where appropriate, units approved by the BIPM
for use with the SI (e.g. minute). A list of SI units and units approved for use with the SI may be found in the SI
brochure at www.bipm.org. The use of imperial/customary units such as the inch and degree Fahrenheit is
not acceptable and should be discouraged. In all examinations, where data is supplied for use in questions,
candidates will be expected to use units that are consistent with the units supplied, and should not attempt
conversion to other systems of units unless this is a requirement of the question.

5    Practical assessment
## Introduction
Teachers should ensure that learners practise experimental skills throughout their course of study. As a guide,
learners should spend at least 20 per cent of their time doing practical work individually or in small groups. This
20 per cent does not include the time spent observing demonstrations of experiments.
The practical work that learners do during their course should aim to:
•provide learning opportunities so they develop the skills they need to carry out experimental and
investigative work
•reinforce their learning of the theoretical subject content of the syllabus
•instil an understanding of the relationship between experimentation and theory in scientific method
•be enjoyable, contributing to the motivation of learners.
Candidates’ experimental skills will be assessed in Paper 3 and Paper 5. In each of these papers, the questions
may be based on physics not included in the syllabus content, but candidates will be assessed on their
practical skills rather than their knowledge of theory. Where appropriate, candidates will be given any additional
information that they need.
## Paper 3 Advanced Practical Skills
Paper 3 is a timetabled, laboratory-based practical paper focusing on the experimental skills of:
•manipulation, measurement and observation
•presentation of data and observations
•analysis, conclusions and evaluation.
Centres should refer to the document ‘How to manage your sciences practical exams’ for advice on making
entries and organisation of candidates for practical exams.
Paper 3 consists of two questions, each of 1 hour and each of 20 marks.
Question 1 will be an experiment requiring candidates to collect data, to plot a graph and to draw conclusions.
Question 2 will be an experiment requiring candidates to collect data and to draw conclusions, but may or
may not include the plotting of a graph. In the second question, the experimental method to be followed will be
inaccurate, and candidates will be required to evaluate the method and suggest improvements.
The two questions will be set in different areas of physics. No prior knowledge of the theory will be required.

Expectations for each skill (Paper 3)
Manipulation, measurement and observation
Successful collection of data
Candidates should be able to:
•set up apparatus correctly without assistance from the supervisor
•follow instructions given in the form of written instructions and diagrams (including circuit diagrams)
•use their apparatus to collect an appropriate quantity of data
•repeat readings where appropriate
•make measurements using common laboratory apparatus, such as millimetre scales, protractors, top-pan
balances, newton meters, analogue or digital electrical meters, measuring cylinders, calipers*, micrometer
screw gauges and thermometers
•use a stop-watch to measure intervals of time, including the period of an oscillating system by timing an
appropriate number of consecutive oscillations
•use both analogue scales and digital displays.
- Where calipers are required in the examination, centres may provide either vernier or digital calipers.
Candidates should be familiar with the type of calipers provided.
Some candidates will be unable to set up their apparatus without help and may ask for assistance from the
supervisor. Supervisors will be given clear instructions on what assistance may be given to candidates, but
this assistance should never go beyond the minimum necessary to enable candidates to take some readings:
under no circumstances should help be given with the presentation of data, analysis or evaluation sections. All
assistance must be reported to the examiners by recording details of the help given on the supervisor’s report,
and candidates who require assistance will not be awarded full credit for the successful collection of data.
Quality of data
Candidates should be able to:
•make and record accurate measurements
•make measurements that span the largest possible range of values within the limits either of the equipment
provided or of the instructions given.
Marks will be awarded for measured data in which the values obtained are reasonable. In some cases, the
award of the mark will be based on the scatter of points on a graph; in other cases, the candidate’s data may
be compared with information supplied by the supervisor or known to the examiners. The examiners will only
consider the extent to which the candidate has affected the quality of the data: allowances will be made where
the quality of data is limited by the experimental method required or by the apparatus used.

## 45

Back to contents page
Presentation of data and observations
Table of results
Candidates should be able to:
•present numerical data and values in a single table of results
•record all data in the table
•draw up the table in advance of taking readings so that they do not have to copy up their results
•include in the table of results columns for raw data and for values calculated from them
•use column headings that include both the quantity and the unit and that conform to accepted scientific
conventions.
As an example of accepted scientific convention in column headings, if the quantity being measured is current
in milliamperes, then ‘I /  mA’ would be the usual way to write the column heading, but ‘I in mA’ or ‘I (mA)’ or
‘current /  mA’ would be allowed. Headings such as ‘I mA’ or just ‘mA’ are not acceptable. The quantity or the
unit or both may be written in words rather than symbols. Conventional symbols or abbreviations (such as p.d.)
may be used without explanation.
Recording of data, observations and calculations
Candidates should be able to:
•record raw readings of a quantity to the same degree of precision
•calculate other quantities from their raw data
•show their working in calculations, and the key steps in their reasoning
•use and justify the correct number of significant figures in calculated quantities.
For example, if one measurement of length in a column of raw data is given to the nearest millimetre, then all
the lengths in that column should be given to the nearest millimetre. The degree of precision used should be
compatible with the measuring instrument used: it would be inappropriate to record a distance measured on a
millimetre scale as either ‘2 cm’ or ‘2.00 cm’.
When a value is calculated from measured quantities (except by addition or subtraction), the appropriate
number of significant figures for the calculated value usually depends on the measured quantity with the least
number of significant figures.  If this quantity has n significant figures, then n or n+1 significant figures are
appropriate for the calculated value.
For example, if values of a potential difference and of a current are measured to 2 and 4 significant figures
respectively, then the corresponding resistance should be given to 2 or 3 significant figures, but not 1 or 4. The
number of significant figures may, if necessary, vary down a column of values for a calculated quantity.
## Graph: Layout
Candidates should be able to:
•clearly label graph axes with both the quantity and the unit, following accepted scientific conventions
•choose scales for graph axes such that the data points occupy at least half of the graph grid in both x- and
y-directions
•use a false origin where appropriate
•choose scales for the graph axes that allow the graph to be read easily, such as 1, 2 or 5 units to a 2 cm
square
•place regularly-spaced numerical labels along the whole of each axis at least every 2 cm.
The accepted scientific conventions for labelling the axes of a graph are the same as for the column headings
in a table of results.

Graph: Plotting of points
Candidates should be able to:
•plot all their data points on their graph grid to an accuracy of better than 1 mm.
Points should be finely drawn with a sharp pencil, but must still be visible. A fine cross or an encircled dot is
suitable; plotted points should have a diameter of less than 1 mm.
Graph: Trend line
Candidates should be able to:
•draw straight lines of best fit or curves to show the trend of a graph
•draw tangents to curved trend lines.
The trend line should show an even distribution of points on either side of the line along its whole length. Lines
should be finely drawn, continuous, and with a thickness of less than 1 mm, and should not contain kinks. If
necessary, candidates may identify one point as anomalous and ignore this point when drawing the line. The
anomalous point must be identified, e.g. circled or labelled.
Analysis, conclusions and evaluation
Interpretation of graph
Candidates should be able to:
•relate straight-line graphs to equations of the form y = mx + c, and derive expressions that equate to the
gradient and/or the y-intercept of their graphs
•read the coordinates of points on the trend line of a graph
•determine the gradient of a straight-line graph or of a tangent to a curve
•determine the y-intercept of a straight-line graph or of a tangent to a curve, including where these are on
graphs with a false origin.
When a gradient is to be determined, the points on the line chosen for the calculation should be separated by
more than half of the length of the line drawn.
In cases where the y-intercept cannot be read directly from the y-axis, it is expected that the coordinates of a
point on the line and the gradient will be substituted into y = mx + c to determine the y-intercept.
Estimating uncertainties
Candidates should be able to:
•estimate the absolute uncertainty in measurements
•express the uncertainty in a measurement as an absolute or percentage uncertainty, and translate between
these forms
•express the absolute uncertainty in a repeated measurement as half the range of the repeated readings,
where this is appropriate.

Drawing conclusions
Candidates should be able to:
•draw conclusions from an experiment, including determining the values of constants
•explain whether experimental data supports a given hypothesis
•make predictions.
To determine whether a relationship containing a constant is supported by experimental data, candidates
should:
•calculate the percentage difference between values of the constant
•compare this percentage difference with a given percentage uncertainty
•give a conclusion based on this comparison.
Identifying limitations
Candidates should be able to:
•identify and describe the limitations in an experimental procedure
•identify the most significant sources of uncertainty in an experiment.
For uncertainties in measured quantities, candidates should state the quantity being measured and a reason for
the uncertainty.
Suggesting improvements
Candidates should be able to:
•suggest modifications to an experimental arrangement that will improve the accuracy of the experiment or
to extend the investigation to answer a new question
•describe these modifications clearly in words or diagrams.
Candidates’ suggestions should be realistic, so that in principle they are achievable in practice in a school
laboratory. The suggestions may include the use of other apparatus or different procedures, but not a different
experiment. The suggested modifications may relate to sources of uncertainty identified by the candidate.
Improvements that could have been made with the apparatus provided while following the instructions in the
question will not normally gain credit.
Administration of Paper 3
Detailed regulations on the administration of Cambridge International practical examinations are contained in
the Cambridge Handbook.
Details of the specific requirements for apparatus and materials for a particular examination are given in the
confidential instructions which are sent to centres several weeks prior to the examination. Centres should
contact Cambridge International if they believe the confidential instructions have not been received.
It is the responsibility of centres to provide the apparatus for practical examinations. Cambridge is not able to
supply apparatus directly or provide advice on local suppliers of apparatus.

Paper 5 Planning, Analysis and Evaluation
Paper 5 will be a timetabled written paper, focusing on the higher-order experimental skills of planning, analysis
and evaluation.
This examination will not require laboratory facilities.
To prepare candidates for this exam, it should be emphasised that candidates will need extensive experience
of laboratory work of A Level standard. In particular, learners cannot be taught to plan experiments effectively
unless, on a number of occasions, they are required to:
•plan an experiment
•perform the experiment according to their plan
•evaluate what they have done.
This requires many hours of laboratory-based work and careful supervision from teachers to ensure that
experiments are performed safely.
Paper 5 will consist of two questions each of 15 marks.
Question 1 will be a planning question, in which candidates will be required to design an experimental
investigation of a given problem. The question will not be highly structured: candidates will be expected to
answer with a diagram and an extended piece of writing.
Question 2 will be an analysis, conclusions and evaluation question, in which candidates will be given an
equation and some experimental data. From these they will be required to find the value of a constant. This
question will be structured but candidates will be expected to decide for themselves what they need to do in
order to reach an answer. They will also be required to estimate the uncertainty in their answer.
Some questions on this paper may be set in areas of physics that are difficult to investigate experimentally in
school laboratories, either because of the cost of equipment or because of restrictions on the availability of
materials (e.g. radioactive materials). No question will require knowledge of theory or equipment that is beyond
the syllabus. Candidates will be given the necessary information for questions set on topics that do not form
part of the syllabus.

For full credit to be awarded in this section, the overall arrangement must be workable, that is, it should be
possible to collect the data required without undue difficulty if the apparatus were assembled as described.
The measuring instruments chosen should be fit for purpose, in that they should measure the correct physical
quantity to a suitable precision for the experiment.
Method of analysis
Candidates should be able to:
•describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion, including details of derived quantities
to be calculated from graphs.
Additional detail including safety considerations
Marks will be available for additional relevant detail including safety precautions.
How these marks are awarded will depend on the experiment that is to be planned, but they might, for
example, include marks for describing how additional variables are to be kept constant, or for a diagram of a
circuit needed to make a particular measurement or a description of initial experiments or an explanation of
how to obtain calibration curves.
For safety considerations, candidates should be able to:
•assess the risks of their experiment
•describe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum.
Candidates should be able to:
•describe the use of an oscilloscope (or storage oscilloscope) to measure voltage, current, time and
frequency
•describe how to use light gates connected to a data logger to determine time, velocity and acceleration
•describe how other sensors can be used with a data logger, e.g. motion sensor.
Analysis, conclusions and evaluation
Data analysis
Candidates should be able to:
•rearrange expressions into the forms y = mx + c, y = ax
n
and y = ae
kx
•understand how a graph of y against x is used to find the constants m and c in an equation of the form
y = mx + c
•understand how a graph of log y against log x is used to find the constants a and n in an equation of the
form y = ax
n
•understand how a graph of ln y against x is used to find the constants a and k in an equation of the form
y = ae
kx
•decide what derived quantities to calculate from raw data in order to enable an appropriate graph to be
plotted.

Table of results
Candidates should be able to:
•complete a table of results following the conventions required for Paper 3
•calculate other quantities from raw data and record them in a table
•use the correct number of significant figures for calculated quantities following the conventions required for
## Paper 3.
Where logarithms are required, units should be shown with the quantity whose logarithm is being taken,
e.g. ln (d /  cm). The logarithm itself does not have a unit.
For logarithmic quantities, the number of decimal places should correspond to the number of significant figures.
For example, if L /  cm is 76.5 (3 sf), then lg (L /  cm) should be either 1.884 (3 dp) or 1.8837 (4 dp).
## Graph
Candidates should be able to:
•plot a graph following the conventions required for Paper 3
•show error bars, in both directions where appropriate, for each point on the graph
•draw a straight line of best fit and a worst acceptable straight line through the points on the graph.
The worst acceptable line should be either the steepest possible line or the shallowest possible line that passes
through the error bars of all the data points. It should be distinguished from the line of best fit either by being
drawn as a broken line or by being clearly labelled.
## Conclusion
Candidates should be able to:
•determine the gradient and y-intercept of a straight-line graph
•derive expressions that equate to the gradient or the y-intercept of their straight lines of best fit
•draw the required conclusions, with correct units and appropriate number of significant figures, from these
expressions.
Treatment of uncertainties
Candidates should be able to:
•convert absolute uncertainty estimates into fractional or percentage uncertainty estimates and vice versa
•show uncertainty estimates, in absolute terms, beside every value in a table of results
•calculate uncertainty estimates in derived quantities
•estimate the absolute uncertainty in the gradient of a graph by recalling that
absolute uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line
•estimate the absolute uncertainty in the y-intercept of a graph by recalling that
absolute uncertainty = y-intercept of line of best fit – y-intercept of worst acceptable line
•express a quantity as a value, an uncertainty estimate and a unit.
