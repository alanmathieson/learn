Marking guidance for Paper 2: Written response to works and
translation
This marking guidance is for the use of Pearson-appointed external examiners. The guidance
has been included for teacher reference to aid understanding of how the assessment criteria
will be applied.
Section A – Question 1 (translation into Russian)
This task is marked using a points-based mark scheme in which 1 mark is given for each
correct individual section of language. Please see the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE
in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document for an example of how the
translation will be marked.
Sections B and C – Questions 2 to 11 (written response to works)
There are three levels-based mark grids to be applied to each individual essay that makes up
the written response to works. The mark grids are:
● Critical and analytical response (AO4)
● Range of grammatical structures and vocabulary (AO3)
● Accuracy of language (AO3).
General guidance on using levels-based mark schemes
Step 1: Decide on a marking band
● First of all, the examiner will consider the answer as a whole and then decide which
descriptors most closely match the answer and place it in that band. The descriptors for
each band indicate the different features that will be seen in the student’s answer for that
band.
● When assigning a level, the examiner will look at the overall quality of the answer and not
focus disproportionately on small and specific parts of the answer where the student has not
performed quite as well as the rest. If the answer covers different aspects of different bands
of the mark scheme, the examiner will use a ‘best fit’ approach for defining the level. They
will then use the variability of the response to help decide the mark within the level, for
example if the response is predominantly band 5–8 with a small amount of band 9–12
material, it would be placed in band 5–8 but be awarded a mark near the top of the band
because of the band 9–12 content.
Step 2: Decide on a mark
● Once the examiner has decided on a band they will need to decide on a mark within the
band.
● They will decide on the mark to award based on the quality of the answer; they will award a
mark towards the top or bottom of that band, depending on how the student has evidenced
each of the descriptor bullet points.
● The examiner will modify the mark based on how securely the trait descriptors are met at
that band.
● They will need to go back through the answer as they apply the mark scheme to clarify
points and assure themselves that the band and the mark are appropriate.

## 15
Critical and analytical response (AO4)
● This mark grid assesses students’ ability to respond critically and analytically to the aspect
of the literary work or film outlined in the question. To provide a critical and analytical
response, students should select relevant material, present and justify points of view,
develop arguments, draw conclusions based on understanding and evaluate issues, themes
and cultural and social contexts.
● This grid should be applied twice, once for each essay individually.
● When deciding how to reward an answer, examiners will consult this mark grid as well as
the indicative content associated with each question, which can be found in the document
Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs).
Indicative content contains points that students are likely to use to construct their answer.
It is possible for an answer to be constructed without mentioning some or all of these points
as long as students provide alternative responses that fulfil the requirements of the
question.

## Marks Description
0 No rewardable material.
## 1–4
● Response relates to the work but limited focus on the question.
● Points of view relating to issues/themes/cultural or social contexts are presented
with simplistic justification; limited interpretation with frequent misunderstanding or
confusion; any evidence from the work is descriptive.
● Limited ability to form arguments or draw conclusions.
## 5–8
● Response relates to the work but often loses focus on the question.
● Points of view relating to issues/themes/cultural or social contexts are presented,
with attempts made at interpretation, but they occasionally show misunderstanding
or confusion; evidence selected from the work for justification is occasionally
appropriate but often descriptive.
● Arguments are made but with inconsistencies; conclusions are drawn but do not fully
link to arguments.
## 9–12
● Response is relevant to particular aspects of the question, occasional loss of focus.
● Critical analysis of issues/themes/cultural or social contexts is evident in relation to
particular aspects of the question, with some appropriate interpretations and points
of view, sometimes justified by appropriately selected evidence from the work.
● Logical arguments are followed through on particular aspects of the question,
occasionally detailed and with linked conclusions; some points are made without
exploration.
## 13  –16
● Predominantly relevant response to the question.
● Critical analysis of issues/themes/cultural or social contexts is frequently
demonstrated, with some convincing interpretations and points of view,
predominantly justified with appropriately selected evidence from the work.
● Generally detailed, logical arguments are made, with some persuasive conclusions
that mostly link together.
## 17  –20
● Relevant response to the question throughout.
● Critical analysis of issues/themes/cultural or social contexts is demonstrated through
convincing interpretations and points of view, consistently justified with
appropriately selected evidence from the work.
● Detailed, logical arguments and conclusions are made that consistently link together.

Range of grammatical structures and vocabulary (AO3)
● This mark grid assesses students’ ability to use a range of grammatical structures and
vocabulary in order to produce articulate written communication with a range of expression.
● This grid will be applied twice, once for each essay individually.

## Marks Description
0 No rewardable language.
## 1–4
● Limited variation of straightforward grammatical structures with much repetition,
producing writing that is often restricted and stilted.
● Limited range of vocabulary resulting in repetitive expression.
● Limited use of terminology appropriate to literary and cinematic analysis.
## 5–8
● Occasional variation in use of mostly straightforward grammatical structures,
infrequent use of complex language, producing writing that is sometimes stilted.
● Vocabulary is mostly high frequency with occasional variation, expression is
frequently repetitive.
● Occasional use of terminology appropriate for literary and cinematic analysis.
## 9–12
● Some variation in the use of grammatical structures, including some recurrent
examples of complex language; sections of articulate writing with occasionally stilted
phrasing.
● Some variation in use of vocabulary, resulting in variation of expression but this is
not sustained.
● Some use of terminology appropriate for literary and cinematic analysis.
## 13  –16
● Frequent variation in use of grammatical structures, including different types of
complex language, producing writing that is articulate throughout the majority of the
essay.
● Frequently varied use of vocabulary, resulting in regular variation of expression.
● Frequent use of terminology appropriate for literary and cinematic analysis.
## 17  –20
● Consistent variation in use of grammatical structures, including in use of complex
language, producing consistently articulate writing.
● Consistently varied use of vocabulary, allowing ideas to be conveyed in a variety of
different ways.
● Consistent use of terminology appropriate for literary and cinematic analysis.
Additional guidance
Variation of vocabulary and grammatical structures: the traits in the mark grid
differentiate between the variation of grammatical structures and vocabulary used by
students. Examiners will judge in which mark band to place students and which mark to
award, based on the effect that the variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary has on
the quality of the communication; the wider the variety, the more articulate the
communication will become (see definition of ‘articulate’ below).
Examples of a variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary are: a selection of different
verbs, tenses, adjectives, vocabulary (including to express literary and cinematic analysis
(see further details below), complex language (see definition below) for a variety of purposes,
including to present and justify points of view, develop arguments, draw conclusions based on
understanding.


Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Russian – Specification –
## Issue 3 – January 20  22   © Pearson Education Limited 2022
## 17
Articulate: articulate communication is fluent, effective and coherent as students
control/manipulate the language to say what they want to say rather than what they can say,
for a number of different purposes. If students are restricted to what they can say, they may
not be able to express themselves for all purposes, for example to develop arguments.
Terminology for literary and cinematic analysis: vocabulary for critical analysis according
to the work being studied, for example ‘plot’, ‘character’; figures of speech such as ‘metaphor’,
‘similes’; to describe theme and style such as, ‘camera technique’, ‘hand-held camera’, ‘use of
black and white’, ‘first person narrative.’
Complex language is considered to include the following:
● using extended sentences to express abstract ideas/convey justified arguments that require
a range of lexis and structures; for example, conjunctions and pronouns
● use of all cases, including nouns, adjectives and pronouns (singular and plural, regular and
common irregular)
● use of comparative and superlative adjectives and adverbs (including common irregulars)
● use of common short form adjectives
● use of cardinal and ordinal numerals, including in oblique cases
● use of verbal aspects
● appropriate sequence of tenses in reported speech/indirect statements/indirect questions
● passive voice, including present active and past passive participles
● gerunds
● conditional mood
● verbs of wanting, commanding with чтобы, further uses of бы and чтобы
● compound conjunctions
● use of relative pronouns
● use of synonyms and a variety of expressions to say things in different ways
● any other grammar and structures included in the grammar list that are specific to A Level.
Straightforward language is considered to be:
● simple sentences with limited linking of sentences and clauses
● high-frequency grammatical structures and vocabulary.

Accuracy of language (AO3)
● This mark grid assesses students’ ability to apply grammar and syntax accurately.
● This grid will be applied twice, once for each essay individually.

## Marks Description
0 No rewardable language.
## 1–2
● Limited sequences of accurate language, resulting in lapses in coherence.
● Errors occur that often prevent meaning being conveyed.
## 3–4
● Some accurate sequences of language, resulting in some coherent writing.
● Errors occur that sometimes hinder clarity of communication and occasionally
prevent meaning being conveyed.
## 5–6
● Frequent sequences of accurate language, resulting in generally coherent writing.
● Errors occur that occasionally hinder clarity of communication.
## 7–8
● Accurate language throughout most of the essay, resulting in mostly coherent
writing.
● Errors occur that rarely hinder clarity of communication.
## 9–10
● Accurate language throughout, resulting in consistently coherent writing.
● Any errors do not hinder clarity of communication.
Additional guidance
Errors: students   are not expected to produce perfect, error-free writing in order
to access the
top band. The mark grid describes the frequency of errors and the impact that errors have on
coherence.
Errors that do not hinder clarity:
● errors that do not affect meaning, for example misspellings such as разказать
(for рассказать), мушчина (for мужчина), крассный (for красный)
● infrequent errors that do not distract the reader from the content and that result in coherent
writing, for example incorrect use of demonstratives (for example это персонаж
появляется.... - for этот персонаж...); use of a singular noun when a plural is more
appropriate (for example их отношение с героем - for их отношения ...); incorrect use of
short form adjectives (for example она жилa далека - for она жила далеко).
Errors that hinder clarity:
● errors that make writing difficult to understand immediately (even if the meaning is
eventually understood)/errors that force readers to re-read in order to understand what is
meant, for example misspellings such as поп-мазыка (for поп-музыка), маланки (for
маленький), пириработат (for переработать)
● frequent errors that hinder clarity as they distract the reader from the content of the writing,
for example several misspellings combining to produce a cumulative effect (for example это
проблем встречает визде в Росси - for эта проблема встречается везде в России).
Errors that prevent meaning being conveyed:
● errors that mean the reader cannot understand the message, for example он роботит (for
они работают)
● errors that convey the wrong message, for example купит (for купить), тошно
(for точно), чисто (for часто)
● mother-tongue interference.
NB: these are examples only and do not constitute a finite list.

## Paper 3: Speaking
## Content
Students should be able to demonstrate:
● knowledge and understanding of the cultural context by giving ideas, examples and
information on one of the themes and on a chosen subject of interest they have researched
linked to the social and cultural context of the language studied
● the ability to analyse aspects of the cultural context by presenting and justifying valid
arguments, viewpoints and conclusions
● the ability to interact and hold a natural and fluent discourse
● skill in manipulating language accurately
● the ability to respond to written language in speech.
These aspects are assessed via two distinct tasks conducted entirely in the target language,
which are carried out in consecutive order in one session.
Task 1 (discussion on a theme)
Content for this task will be based on any one of the twelve sub-themes from one of the four
overall themes listed on pages 8–9. Stimulus cards will be given as a springboard to the
discussion.
Task 2 (presentation and discussion on student’s independent research
project)
This task is in two parts. Content for this task will be based on the subject of interest that
students have chosen for their independent research project. This may be based on any of the
four themes of study listed on pages 8–9 or on a subject of interest of the student’s choosing.
However, it must relate to the Russian-speaking cultural and social context.
Assessment information
● First assessment: April/May 2019.
● Timing for the speaking assessment:
o Task 1: 6 to 7 minutes (recommended)
o Task 2: 10 to 11 minutes (recommended)
o Total assessment time: 21 to 23 minutes, (16 to 18 minutes of speaking plus 5 minutes’
preparation time for Task 1).
Recommended timings have been given for each task to enable the student to complete
each one in sufficient time to access the full range of assessment criteria for both tasks.
● The assessment is out of 72 marks.
● Students complete two tasks – Task 1 is worth 30 marks and Task 2 is worth 42 marks.
● Assessments will be conducted by teacher-examiners in centres in one session within a
prescribed five-week assessment period. This will take place in April and May in any single
year. Dates for the assessment period will be confirmed in the UK Information Manual at
the start of each academic year. The assessment period will not always be continuous or be
the same period each year, for example it will need to accommodate the Easter break,
which changes each year.

## 20
Allocation of stimulus cards
● The invigilator uses the sequencing grid provided by Pearson to allocate the choice of
sub-themes to the student. The stimulus cards based on the sub-themes are issued in the
order prescribed by Pearson. Neither the invigilator nor the teacher-examiner chooses the
order of the cards.
● The invigilator gives the student a choice in English of two sub-themes, using the wording
for the sub-themes given on the sequencing grid, for example: ‘You may choose 'The lives
of young Russians' or ‘1991’. The student does not see the content of the stimulus card at
this stage.
● The sub-themes will come from two of the four overall Themes listed on pages 8–9. There is
a stimulus card for each sub-theme. There are 12 stimulus cards in total (three per theme).
● Once the student has chosen their sub-theme, the invigilator gives the student the
corresponding stimulus card. This happens immediately before the preparation time begins.
Roles of the teacher-examiner and invigilator
● As well as supervising students during their 5 minutes’ preparation time, the invigilator is
responsible for giving students the choice of two sub-themes for the assessment, based on
the sequencing grid provided by Pearson (see example sequencing grid in General
instructions to the teacher-examiner included in the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE
in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document).
● The teacher-examiner is responsible for conducting the assessment. They are not
responsible for providing the stimulus cards.
Preparation time and notes
● The preparation time of 5 minutes begins immediately after the student receives the card.
Students have 5 minutes to prepare to speak about their card.
● The preparation time must be supervised and must take place immediately before the
assessment takes place. It must take place outside of the examination room with an
invigilator.
● Each stimulus card contains two statements (A and B) offering different views on the
sub-theme. Students select one statement from the two given on the stimulus card during
their 5-minute preparation time. Students give their views on the statement during the
discussion.
● Students are permitted to make notes (up to a maximum of one side of A4) during the
5-minute preparation time. Students may refer to these notes during the assessment. The
notes should be used for reference only, and students should not read out whole, prepared
sentences. Students are not permitted to write on the stimulus cards.

## 21
Task 1 (discussion on a theme)
● Task 1 follows immediately after the 5 minutes’ preparation time so that students can recall
their prepared thoughts easily.
● The student must tell the teacher-examiner which statement they have chosen immediately
before the discussion begins.
● Students have approximately 6 to 7 minutes’ discussion time for this task.
● There are two parts to the discussion:
o Part 1: the teacher-examiner asks the two compulsory questions in the order that they
appear on the card. The compulsory questions may be repeated but rephrasing is not
allowed. The teacher-examiner then helps to develop the discussion by asking
appropriate follow-up questions relating to the statement on the stimulus card.
o Part 2: the teacher-examiner then broadens the discussion to cover other aspects of the
overall theme. Optional generic questions are provided by Pearson as a guide to the
questions the teacher-examiner should ask in order to enable the student to meet the
requirements of the assessment criteria, i.e. to elicit examples and information to
demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the cultural and social context and to
analyse aspects of the theme by developing and justifying arguments and forming
conclusions.
Task 2 (presentation and discussion on student’s independent research project)
● Students have approximately 10 to 11 minutes for this task.
● There are two parts to this task.
o Part 1: the discussion must open with a presentation from the student in which they
provide a summary of at least two of the written sources they have used as part of their
research, outlining the authors’ main points/ideas and giving a personal response to what
they have read. The presentation must not exceed two minutes. In this part of the task,
students are assessed on their ability to respond in speech to written sources.
o Part 2: the discussion must be broadened out to a wider exploration of the content of
the student’s presentation and of their research as a whole. The teacher-examiner should
use the key findings and list of sources on Form RP3 in Appendix 1: Independent
research form (RP3) to help them formulate their own questions. Optional generic
questions are provided by Pearson as a guide to the questions the teacher-examiner
should ask in order to enable the student to meet the requirements of the assessment
criteria, i.e. to elicit examples and information to demonstrate their knowledge and
understanding of the cultural and social context and to analyse aspects of the theme by
developing and justifying arguments and forming conclusions.
In both tasks, students are expected to ask questions that elicit opinions as part of the
natural discourse and to confirm that their own points of view have been understood (see
guidance provided on Elicit points of view/check for understanding beneath the mark grids for
Interaction (AO1) in the specification and the Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in
Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document). Students are also expected to take
the lead in the discussions.
The teacher-examiner will cover all parts of each task and ask appropriate questions to ensure
that the student is able to access the maximum amount of marks available. The speaking
assessment will last between 16 to 18 minutes (plus 5 minutes’ preparation time) and the
teacher  -examiner will ensure that timings are followed. The timing of the assessment begins
with the student’s first utterance in relation to Task 1. Once the maximum stipulated
assessment time has passed, the teacher-examiner will bring the assessment to a natural end,
allowing the student to complete their last sentence. They will turn off the recording device at
that point. Centres should be aware that students will not receive any marks for any
conversation that takes place beyond the maximum time allowed.

Guidance on the independent research project
For the purposes of the assessment, independent research means research carried out without
the help or instruction of others, including teachers.
The independent research project must relate to the Russian-speaking cultural and/or social
context. It should be based on a subject of interest of the student’s choosing, but may be
based on any of the four themes of study from the specification.
The independent research project must not be based on one of the literary works or films
studied for Paper 2 but can focus on a wider exploration of the author or film-maker of those
works studied. For example, if studying a novel by a particular author for Paper 2, the
independent research must not focus on that novel as it would be a duplication of content.
However, it could focus on the life of the author or the aspects that motivated the author in
the broader sense.
The independent research project must:
● be based on a question or statement defined and developed by the student individually to
investigate a particular area of interest specifically related to the Russian-speaking culture
and/or society
● include evidence of the student’s research findings, investigated independently, from a
range of authentic sources, including the internet
● enable the student to independently contextualise, analyse and summarise findings
● enable the student to identify at least two written sources, which they can summarise and
give a personal response to in their presentation.
The table below gives guidance on the process that could be followed.

## 23

## Stage Description
## 1 Pre-independent
research
● Teacher instruction on how to conduct research, for example the
teacher gives advice on suitable resources and how to analyse
information.
● Initial conversations with the teacher on possible questions or
statements that the student may use for their independent research
project.
● Subsequent to the above, the student should develop independently
the focus of their question or statement.
● The teacher checks that the student’s question or statement will
allow the student to access the full range of marks.
## 2 Independent
research
● The student conducts research to find and select appropriate sources
(including written sources).
● The teacher monitors the project by giving general feedback.
(See Controls relating to student independence and teacher guidance
to students for the independent research project on the following
page).
3 Analysis of
information
● Students record the 6–10 key findings of their research on
Form RP3 and prepare to give information about and analyse their
findings, ensuring that all material is clearly linked to the target
language culture.
● In preparation for their two-minute presentation, students prepare to
summarise the main points/ideas from at least two of the written
sources they have used as part of their research and to give a
relevant personal response.

It is recommended that students start on the identification stage as early as possible in the
academic year. However, learning hours for the independent research project are not specified
because the process of information collation and investigation are undertaken independently.
Students should be prepared to talk in detail about their subject of interest for 10–11 minutes.

Controls relating to student independence and teacher guidance to
students for the independent research project
Teachers can:
● give guidance on developing research skills (including methodology and analytical tools)
● give guidance on selecting a subject and question or statement for the student’s
independent research project
● explain what independence means (see definition in Guidance on the independent research
project)
● comment on the suitability of the area of research (availability of resources, time
constraints)
● give guidance and advice on completing Form RP3
● advise and direct students to the Assessment Objectives
● provide a selection of resources for student access.
Teachers must:
● confirm that the question or statement has the potential to meet the requirements of the
assessment criteria and offer general guidance on any necessary amendments
● ensure that the question or statement does not correspond with one of the literary works or
films that the student has studied for Paper 2. Teachers will be able to identify this from the
information given on Form RP3. Students will receive a mark of zero for Task 2 if their
independent research project focuses on a work studied for Paper 2
● review each student’s Form RP3. Teachers should ensure that the research meets the
specification requirements, and they should give general guidance on the methodology and
analytical tools that the student could use
● promote good practice such as referencing and using a bibliography system
● sign the student’s Form RP3 before the examination to declare that the independent
research project is wholly the student’s work
● monitor the different research projects being undertaken in a centre to ensure that
independence is being maintained. If more than one student chooses to research the same
topic, the teacher must ensure that each student has a different question or statement and
therefore an independent focus.
Teachers must not:
● give students a choice of questions or statements from which they then choose, including a
group question or statement for whole-class research
● give detailed feedback or guidance to individual students about how to improve their work
to meet the requirements of the assessment criteria. The guidance provided should enable
students only to take the initiative in making amendments, rather than detailing what
amendments should be made
● rehearse or provisionally assess the student’s presentation and give feedback so that the
student may then improve it
● provide access to, or rehearse, questions that will be used in the assessment of the
student’s independent research.
If the above controls are not adhered to, we will investigate this as a potential case of
malpractice. If malpractice is found to have taken place, a penalty will be applied dependent
on the circumstances and severity of the malpractice.
For full details on malpractice, please see the section entitled Malpractice on page 47 and the
JCQ document Suspected Malpractice in Examinations and Assessments 2016–17.

## 25
Students must:
● initiate and conduct their own research and develop their research skills when investigating
their subject of personal interest
● include written sources for their research which are in the assessed language (students
must refer to at least two written sources in their presentation). These could include
newspaper and magazine articles, online written sources, journals, literary texts and any
other suitable written source that can be referenced. However, students can use and refer
to other authentic sources that they have used in their research during the discussion that
fo llows the presentation. These could include films, television, radio, online audio-visual
material and interviews
● complete and sign the independent research project form and submit it no later than three
weeks in advance of the date of the assessment (see Appendix 1: Independent research
project form (RP3)).
Support for teachers
Pearson will provide exemplar material relating to student performance. In order to support
teachers in preparing for the speaking component, Pearson will provide a video on how to
conduct the speaking assessment.

Marking guidance for Paper 3: Speaking
This marking guidance is for the use of Pearson-appointed external examiners. The guidance
has been included for teacher reference to aid understanding of how the assessment criteria
will be applied.
There are a number of levels-based mark schemes to be applied to Tasks 1 and 2.
General guidance on using levels-based mark schemes
Step 1: Decide on a marking band
● First of all, the examiner will consider the answer as a whole and then decide which
descriptors most closely match the answer and place it in that band. The descriptors for
each band indicate the different features that will be seen in the student’s answer for that
band.
● When assigning a band, the examiner will look at the overall quality of the answer and not
focus disproportionately on small and specific parts of the answer where the student has not
performed quite as well as the rest or indeed has performed temporarily better. If the
answer covers different aspects of different bands of the mark scheme, they will use a ‘best
fit’ approach for defining the band. They will then use the variability of the response to help
decide the mark within the band, for example if the response is predominantly band 4–6
with a small amount of band 7–9 material, it would be placed in band 4–6 but be awarded a
mark near the top of the band because of the band 7–9 content.
Step 2: Decide on a mark
● Once the examiner has decided on a band they will then need to decide on a mark within
the band.
● The examiner will decide the mark to award based on the quality of the answer; they will
award a mark towards the top or bottom of that band depending on how the student has
evidenced each of the descriptor bullet points.
● The examiner will modify the mark based on how securely the trait descriptors are met at
that band.
● The examiner will need to go back through the answer as they apply the mark scheme to
clarify points and to assure that the band and the mark are appropriate.
Guidance on timing of the speaking assessment
The teacher-examiner (TE) will cover all parts of each task and ask appropriate questions to
ensure that the student is able to access the maximum amount of marks available. The
speaking assessment will last between 16 to 18 minutes in total, and the TE will ensure that
timings are followed. The timing of the assessment begins with the student’s first utterance in
relation to Task 1. Once the maximum stipulated assessment time has passed, the TE will
bring the assessment to a natural end, allowing the student to complete a final sentence. They
will turn off the recording device at that point. Centres should be aware that candidates will
not receive any marks for any conversation that takes place beyond the maximum time
allowed.

## 27
Task 1 (discussion on a theme)
Three mark grids are applied to Task 1:
● knowledge and understanding of society and culture (AO4)
● accuracy and range of language (AO3)
● interaction (AO1).
Knowledge and understanding of society and culture (AO4)
This grid assesses students’ ability to communicate information about and demonstrate
appreciation of different aspects of Russian-speaking culture and society.
Students are also assessed on their ability to respond critically and analytically to different
aspects of Russian-speaking culture and society by selecting relevant material, presenting and
justifying points of view, developing arguments, drawing conclusions based on understanding
and evaluating issues, themes and cultural and social contexts.
When deciding how to reward an answer, examiners will consult this mark grid and the AL
speaking Task 1: indicative content associated with each question. This is included in the
document Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Russian Sample Assessment Materials
(SAMs). Indicative content contains points that students might use to construct their answer.
It is possible for an answer to be constructed without mentioning some or all of these points,
as long as students provide alternative responses that fulfil the requirements of the question.

## Marks Description
0 No rewardable material.
## 1–3
● Occasionally relevant, straightforward ideas, mostly generalised, occasionally
supported by information/examples/references; frequent loss of focus on the
Russian-speaking cultural and social context.
● Occasional evidence of analysis of the Russian-speaking cultural and social
context; points of view are given with limited justification, arguments may be
made but not developed, occasionally leading to straightforward conclusions that
may be contradictory; mainly relies on description rather than analysis.
## 4–6
● Relevant, straightforward ideas sometimes supported by
information/examples/references; some loss of focus on the Russian-speaking
cultural and social context.
● Some analysis of the Russian-speaking cultural and social context is evident,
with straightforward arguments and points of view, which are sometimes
developed and justified, sometimes drawing straightforward conclusions; relies
on description rather than analysis in places.
## 7–9
● Relevant, occasionally perceptive ideas frequently supported by pertinent
information/examples/references; focus predominantly maintained on the
Russian-speaking cultural and social context.
● Analysis of the Russian-speaking cultural and social context demonstrated by
fr equently developed and justified arguments and viewpoints, often drawing
convincing conclusions.
## 10  –12
● Relevant, perceptive ideas consistently supported by pertinent information/
examples/references; consistently focused on the Russian-speaking cultural and
social context.
● Analysis of the Russian-speaking cultural and social context demonstrated by
consistently developed and justified arguments and viewpoints, drawing
convincing conclusions.

Additional guidance
Perceptive: demonstrates an in-depth understanding by making connections between ideas
and information; goes beyond the standard, predictable response; shows insight/originality.
Ideas include thoughts, feelings, impressions, opinions.
Straightforward ideas, arguments, conclusions are deemed to be those that give the
standard, predictable responses.

Task 1 (discussion on a theme) (continued)
Accuracy and range of language (AO3)
This mark grid assesses students’ ability to use a range of grammatical structures and
vocabulary in order to produce articulate communication with a range of expression. It also
assesses accuracy of pronunciation, grammar and syntax.

## Marks Description
0 No rewardable language.
## 1–3
● Limited variation in the use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, limited or
repetitive use of complex and idiomatic language, occasional variation of
expression; communication is sometimes restricted/stilted.
● Limited sequences of accurate language; often errors occur that hinder clarity of
communication and occasionally prevent meaning being conveyed.
● Pronunciation and intonation are inconsistent, leading to occasional impairment in
communication.
## 4–6
● Some variation in the use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, with use of
some repetitive complex and idiomatic language, resulting in some variation of
expression; some sequences of articulate communication.
● Accurate sequences of language, resulting in some coherent speech; sometimes
errors occur that hinder clarity of communication.
● Pronunciation and intonation are intelligible though sometimes inaccurate.
## 7–9
● Frequent variation in use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, including
examples of complex and idiomatic language, resulting in frequent variation of
expression and frequent sequences of articulate communication.
● Accurate language throughout most of the conversation, resulting in generally
coherent speech; errors occur but rarely hinder clarity of communication.
● Pronunciation and intonation are intelligible and mostly accurate.
## 10  –12
● Consistent variation in use of grammatical structures and vocabulary, including
different types of complex structures and idiomatic language, expressing ideas in a
variety of ways, resulting in articulate communication.
● Accurate language throughout, resulting in coherent speech that is immediately
understandable; any errors do not hinder clarity of the communication.
● Pronunciation and intonation are accurate, intelligible and authentic sounding.



Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Russian – Specification
## Issue 3 – January 20  22   © Pearson Education Limited 2022
## 30
Additional guidance
Complex language is considered to include the following:
● using extended sentences to express abstract ideas/convey justified arguments that require
a range of lexis and structures; for example, conjunctions and pronouns
● use of all cases, including nouns, adjectives and pronouns (singular and plural, regular and
common irregular)
● use of comparative and superlative adjectives and adverbs (including common irregulars)
● use of common short form adjectives
● use of cardinal and ordinal numerals, including in oblique cases
● use of verbal aspects
● appropriate sequence of tenses in reported speech/indirect statements/indirect questions
● passive voice, including present active and past passive participles
● gerunds
● conditional mood
● verbs of wanting, commanding with чтобы, further uses of бы and чтобы
● compound conjunctions
● use of relative pronouns
● use of synonyms and a variety of expressions to say things in different ways
● any other grammar and structures included in the grammar list that are specific to A Level.
Variation in use of grammatical structures and vocabulary: the traits in the mark grid
differentiate between the variation of grammatical structures and vocabulary used by
students. Examiners will judge in which mark band to place students and which mark to
award, based on the effect that the variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary has on
the quality of the communication; the wider the variety, the more articulate the
communication will become (see definition of ‘articulate’ below).
Examples of a variety of grammatical structures and vocabulary are: a selection of different
verbs, tenses, adjectives, vocabulary and complex language (see above for definition of
‘complex language’) for a variety of purposes such as to present and justify points of view,
develop arguments, draw conclusions based on understanding and evaluate issues.
Articulate: articulate communication is fluent, effective and coherent, as students
control/manipulate the language to express with some ease what they want to say for a
number of different purposes. If students are restricted by their language skills, they may not
be able to express themselves for all purposes, for example to develop arguments.
Errors: students   are not expected to produce perfect, error-free speech in   order
to access the
top band. The mark grid describes the frequency of errors and the impact that errors have on
clarity.
Errors that do not hinder clarity:
● errors that do not affect meaning, for example gender, demonstratives, long form
adjectives in place of short forms
● infrequent and isolated errors that do not distract the listener from the overall content of
what is being said.


Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Russian – Specification –
## Issue 3 – January 20  22   © Pearson Education Limited 2022
## 31
Errors that hinder clarity:
● errors that make speech difficult to understand immediately (even if the meaning is
eventually understood) or errors that force listeners to strain to understand what is meant,
for example inappropriate tense formation, mismatch of subject and possessives, mismatch
of adjectives and nouns
● frequent errors hinder clarity, as they distract the listener from the content of what is being
said.
Errors that prevent meaning being conveyed:
● errors that mean the listener cannot understand the message, for example он роботит
(for они работают)
● errors that convey the wrong message, for example купит (for купить), тошно (for точно),
чисто (for часто)
● er  rors that make it unclear who is doing the action, i.e. using the incorrect person of the
verb
● mother- tongue interference.
NB: these are provided as examples only and do not constitute a finite list.

Task 1 (discussion on a theme) (continued)
Interaction (AO1)
This mark grid assesses students’ ability to interact with the teacher-examiner by giving
relevant responses based on what they have heard, by initiating communication and eliciting
points of view.

## Marks Description
0 No rewardable material.
## 1–2
● Interacts with occasional spontaneity to some questions and statements but
requires frequent prompting; occasionally able to sustain the conversation, using
communication strategies if necessary; frequent hesitation.
● Occasionally initiates communication but development often relies on the
examiner’s lead; may elicit points of view/check for understanding, though this
may appear contrived.
## 3–4
● Interacts spontaneously for extended sections of the conversation, responding
mostly with assurance but needing occasional prompting; able to sustain most of
the conversation, using communication strategies if necessary; occasional
hesitation.
● Initiates communication by frequently taking the lead to develop the conversation;
elicits points of view/checks for understanding although occasionally at an
inappropriate moment.
## 5–6
● Interacts spontaneously throughout, responding with assurance to questions and
statements; able to sustain conversation throughout, using communication
strategies if necessary; minimal hesitation.
● Initiates communication by consistently taking the lead to develop the
conversation; elicits points of view/checks for understanding naturally and
appropriately at different points in the conversation.
Additional guidance
Interacts spontaneously: responds to questions and statements that arise as a natural part
of the conversation; gives a relevant, impromptu response based on what they have heard.
Communication strategies: strategies that aid communication and allow the conversation to
be sustained, for example rephrasing, circumlocution, adjusting the message, asking for
clarification/repetition, repair strategies such as self-correction; these strategies enable
students to deliver the message when exact vocabulary or expressions are not known.
Elicit points of view/check for understanding: as part of the language of genuine
discourse, students are required to engage the examiner in the conversation by asking for
their points of view and checking that their own point of view has been understood. They are
ex  pected to do this throughout the speaking assessment at appropriate points during the
conversation. This constitutes questions such as:
● ‘Вы согласны со мной?’
● ‘Разве неправильно подумать, что ...?’
● ‘Можно ли сказать, что ...?’
● ‘Что вы думаете о ...?’
● ‘Вы понимаете, что я хочу сказать?’
The timing of the assessment means that the teacher-examiner should contribute only brief
opinions in response to these types of questions, in order to give students the maximum
length of assessment time.

Task 2, Part 1 (independent research presentation)
One mark grid is applied to this part of the task: responding to written language in
speech (AO2).
Responding to Russian written language in speech (AO2)
This grid is used to assess the student’s two-minute presentation only. It is not applied to the
discussion that follows the presentation. This mark grid assesses students’ ability to
understand and respond in speech to Russian written language drawn from a variety of
sources and to summarise information from written sources in speech. The written sources will
be those that students read in Russian as part of their independent research and they must
refer to at least two named written sources during their presentation.
For guidance on what might be included in the presentation and how it may be structured, see
Indicative content for Task 2 Part 1, independent research presentation in the
document Pearson Edexcel Level 3 Advanced GCE in Russian Sample Assessment Materials
(SAMs).

## Marks Description
0 No rewardable material.
## 1–3
● Summary makes limited reference to named Russian written sources, makes
generalised comments rather than being focused on authors’ main points/ideas.
● Gives a personal response with limited justification, loses focus on the Russian
written sources, straying into general opinion.
Responses that refer to just one single Russian written source can be awarded a
maximum of 3 marks only.
## 4–6
● Summary refers to named Russian written sources but lacks clarity or is uneven in
its coverage of authors’ main points/ideas.
● Gives a mostly relevant personal response with occasional justification, some loss
of focus on the Russian written sources.
## 7–9
● Presents a mostly clear summary of named Russian written sources, generally
clear outline of authors’ main points/ideas.
● Gives a relevant personal response to the Russian written sources supported with
some justification.
## 10  –12
● Presents a clear summary of named Russian written sources, giving a clear outline
of authors’ main points/ideas.
● Gives a convincing personal response to the Russian written sources supported
with clear justification.

Additional guidance
Personal response: this is considered to be giving justified opinions, demonstrating
engagement with the Russian written sources by making focused comments, giving a reaction
to/expressing feelings and thoughts about the Russian written sources.

● knowledge and understanding of society and culture (AO4)
● accuracy and range of language (AO3)
● interaction (AO1).
Knowledge and understanding of Russian-speaking society and culture (AO4)
This grid assesses students’ ability to communicate information about, and demonstrate
appreciation of, different aspects of culture and society related to the countries/communities
where Russian is spoken. They are also assessed on their ability to respond critically and
analytically to different aspects of the culture and society by selecting relevant material,
presenting and justifying points of view, developing arguments, drawing conclusions based on
understanding and evaluating issues.

Task 2, Part 2 (discussion on independent research) (continued)
Interaction (AO1)
This mark grid assesses students’ ability to interact with the teacher-examiner by giving
relevant responses based on what they have heard, by initiating communication and eliciting
points of view.

## Marks Description
0 No rewardable material.
## 1–2
● Interacts with occasional spontaneity to some questions and statements, but
requires frequent prompting; occasionally able to sustain the conversation, using
communication strategies if necessary; frequent hesitation.
● Occasionally initiates communication but development often relies on the examiner’s
lead; may elicit points of view/check for understanding, though this may appear
contrived.
## 3–4
● Interacts spontaneously for extended sections of the conversation, responding
mostly with assurance but needing occasional prompting; able to sustain most of the
conversation, using communication strategies if necessary; occasional hesitation.
● Initiates communication by frequently taking the lead to develop the conversation;
elicits points of view/checks for understanding although occasionally at an
inappropriate moment.
## 5–6
● Interacts spontaneously throughout, responding with assurance to questions and
statements; able to sustain conversation throughout, using communication
strategies if necessary; minimal hesitation.
● Initiates communication by consistently taking the lead to develop the conversation;
elicits points of view/checks for understanding naturally and appropriately at
different points in the conversation.
Additional guidance
Interacts spontaneously: responds to questions and statements that arise as a natural part
of the conversation; gives a relevant, impromptu response based on what they have heard.
Communication strategies: strategies that aid communication and allow the conversation to
be sustained, for example rephrasing, circumlocution, adjusting the message, asking for
clarification/repetition, repair strategies such as self-correction; these strategies enable
students to deliver the message when exact vocabulary or expressions are not known.
Elicit points of view/check for understanding: as part of the language of genuine
discourse, students are required to engage the examiner in the conversation by asking for
their points of view and checking that their own point of view has been understood. They are
expected to do this throughout the speaking assessment at appropriate points during the
conversation. This constitutes questions such as:
● ‘Вы согласны со мной?’
● ‘Разве неправильно подумать, что ...?’
● ‘Можно ли сказать, что ...?’
● ‘Что вы думаете о ...?’
● ‘Вы понимаете, что я хочу сказать?’
The timing of the assessment means that the teacher-examiner should contribute only brief
opinions in response to these types of questions, in order to give students the maximum
length of assessment time.

Administration and general information about the conduct of
the speaking assessment
General information
●A   pack of    assessment materials will be sent to c entres in advance   of    the prescribed
five-week assessment period, which is during April and May. This must be kept in secure
conditions by the Examinations Officer until it is given to the teacher-examiner responsible
for the conduct of the speaking as
sessment. Students must not gain access to these
materials before the assessment commences.
●The teac
her/examiner may open the pack   three working days before the prescribed five
week assessment period, in    order to be familiar with the material and to prepare questions
in advance. The as
sessment materials in    this pack must not be   removed from the centre
premises.
●The teacher-examiner responsible for the conduct of    the speaking assessments is required
to preserve the confidentiality of    the examining materials: these materials must be handed
back to the Examinations Officer on completion of    the tests and must be kept secure.
●Co
mplete, unedited recordings of    all assessments must be   submitted to Pearson via the
online Learner Work Transfer  (LWT) portal.
●All assessments will be marked against assessment criteria found in    the specification and in
the Pearson Edexcel Level 3   Advanced GCE in    Russian Sample   Assessment Materials (SAMs)
document.
●Centres must have procedures in    place to verify the identity of    all students at the time of
the   assessment. They need to confirm this in    the Form RP3 in Appendix 1: Independent
research form (RP3). Centres are required to submit to
Pearson one completed Form RP3 for
each student in    the cohort.
Preparation time and notes
●The notes made during the preparation time should be reference only; students should not
read out whole, prepared sentences.
●The preparation time must be supervised. It must take place outside of the room with an
invigilator. As well as supervising students during their 5 minutes’ preparation time, the
invigilator is responsible for informing students in English of the two sub-themes from which
they can make their choice and for giving them the correct stimulus card based on that
choice.
●A teacher who teaches the subject being examined, or a senior member of teaching staff
who has had overall responsibility for the candidates’ preparation for the examination,
cannot act as an invigilator during the examination (JCQ document Instructions for
conducting examinations, 2016–2017, paragraph 6.3, page 18).
●Students are not permitted to write on the stimulus card.
●Students must return their notes and stimulus card to the teacher-examiner at the end of
the assessment.
●Any notes made during the preparation time must be kept securely by the centre until the
end of October.
●Students cannot have access to a dictionary or any other resource during the preparation
time.
●The teacher-examiner must test that both the machine used for recording the speaking
assessment and the backup machine are working before the assessment begins. Both
machines should be used in order to mitigate against any problems with the recordings, and
recordings should be checked after the assessment to ensure they have worked.

Independent research project form
●Students must submit Form RP3 to the teacher-examiner no later than three weeks before
the date of the assessment, outlining the findings from the sources they have used for their
research.
●The list of sources must include at least two written sources.
●The purpose of the form is to provide sufficient information for the teacher-examiner to
conduct a discussion; students will not be assessed on the contents of Form RP3.
●The summary of the 6 to 10 key research findings is to be completed by the student in
English in advance, on Form RP3.
●Students will be required to declare the literary work(s) and/or film studied for Paper 2 on
Form RP3 so that the teacher-examiner can ensure there is no repetition of this material in
Task 2. Students and teachers must sign a declaration on Form RP3 to confirm all work is
the student’s own.
Students are allowed to refer to their Form RP3 in Task 2, but they are not allowed to write
additional notes on it. It will be checked by the teacher-examiner in the examination room.
Sample assessment materials
Sample student and teacher-examiner cards for the tasks and marking criteria (including
guidance of how these criteria are applied) can be found in the Pearson Edexcel Level 3
Advanced GCE in Russian Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) document.
Marking guidance has been written to accompany the SAMs and is included with the SAMs
booklet. Please note that this guidance is for the use of the Pearson-appointed external
examiners who will mark the assessments. It is printed for reference only so as to aid
understanding of how the criteria are applied.
