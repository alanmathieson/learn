Overarching themes
The overarching themes should be applied along with associated mathematical thinking and
understanding, across the whole of the detailed content in this specification.
These overarching themes are inherent throughout the content and students are required to
develop skills in working scientifically over the course of this qualification. The skills show
teachers which skills need to be included as part of the learning and assessment of the
students.
Overarching theme 1: Mathematical argument, language and proof

Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables and be able to recall the mathematical
formulae and identities set out in Appendix 1.
## Knowledge/skill

Use of data in statistics
Pearson has provided a large data set, which will support the assessment of Statistics in
Paper 3: Statistics and Mechanics. Students are required to become familiar with the data
set in advance of the final assessment.
Assessments will be designed in such a way that questions assume knowledge and
understanding of the data set. The expectation is that these questions should be likely to
give a material advantage to students who have studied and are familiar with the data set.
They might include questions/tasks that:
● assume familiarity with the terminology and contexts of the data, and do not explain them
in a way that gives students who have not studied the data set the same opportunities to
access marks as students who have studied them
● use summary statistics or selected data from, or statistical diagrams based on, the data
set – these might be provided in the question or task, or as stimulus materials
● are based on samples related to the contexts in the data set, where students’ work with
the data set will help them understand the background context and/or
● require students to interpret data in ways that would be too demanding in an unfamiliar
context.
Students will not be required to have copies of the data set in the examination, nor will they
be required to have detailed knowledge of the actual data within the data set.
The data set can be downloaded from our website, qualifications.pearson.com. This data set
should be appropriate for the lifetime of the qualification. However we will review the data
set on an annual basis to ensure it is appropriate. If we need to make changes to the data
set, we will notify centres before the beginning of the two-year course before students
complete their examination.

## Appendix 4: Assessment Objectives
The following tables outline in detail the strands and elements of each Assessment Objective
for A Level Mathematics, as provided by Ofqual in the document GCE Subject Level Guidance
for Mathematics.
● A ‘strand’ is a discrete bullet point that is formally part of an assessment objective
● An ‘element’ is an ability that the assessment objective does not formally separate, but
that could be discretely targeted or credited.

AO1: Use and apply standard techniques.
Learners should be able to:
 select and correctly carry out routine
procedures

context, and, where appropriate, evaluate their
accuracy and limitations
 translate situations in context into
mathematical models
 use mathematical models

recognise the limitations of models and, where
appropriate, explain how to refine them

Assessment Objectives coverage
There will be full coverage of all elements of the Assessment Objectives, with the exception
of AO3.2b and AO3.5c, in each set of A Level Mathematics assessments offered by Pearson.
Elements AO3.2b and AO3.5c will be covered in each route through the qualification within
three years.
